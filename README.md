The repository contains a Python code to parse the archive from https://cr.minzdrav.gov.ru/archive. The main idea of the programm is to download PDF files with their idices used as names prefixes since there are several files having same titles. Otherwise, when manually downloading a file from the website, you get only its index (but not a name).
