The repository contains a Python code to parse the archive from https://cr.minzdrav.gov.ru/archive. The main idea of the programm is to download PDF files with their indices used as prefixes to their titles since there are several files having same titles. Otherwise, when manually downloading a file from the website, you get only its index (but not a name).

The examples of the files are given in the **Examples** folder. Note that the Windows 10 files and folders naming rules are quite strict to save files under their original names, that's why some additional methods were given to parse the files names and save these files under new ones.
